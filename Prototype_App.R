# The UI
#Here I decided to have one row for the inputs (accepting that Iâ€™m probably going to add more inputs before this app is done), one row for all three tables (giving each table 4 columns, 1/3 of the 12 column width), and then one row for the plot:
ui <- fluidPage(
  
  fluidRow(
    #user input to select the product
    column(8, #this box is "8" wide, longer than the next selection box (see below)
           selectInput("code", "Product",
                       choices = setNames(products$prod_code, products$title),
                       width = "100%"
           )
    ),
    #user input to select the variable to plot
    column(2, selectInput("y", "Y axis", c("rate", "count"))) #this box is "2" wide, shorter than the previous selection box
  ),

    #output from server as tables (one for each of diagnosis, body part, and location)
    column(4, tableOutput("diag")),
    column(4, tableOutput("body_part")),
    column(4, tableOutput("location"))

    #output from server as a plot
    column(12, plotOutput("age_sex"))
